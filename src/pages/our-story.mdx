# OUR STORY

A record label shaped between two spheres; driven by passion and intuition, on the mission of bringing constant change and process, as well as celebrating the culture of dance music.

Carefully crafted, Rave Your Soul is mainly focused towards fast-paced grooves, an up to date modern-sounding techno — heavily influenced by the late 90s / 2000’s golden era, but also with a diverse approach — ready to take numerous directions when it comes to electronic music.

Our vision is to develop a platform for new and upcoming generations of artists, a creative space for like-minded souls to show their essential nature in a positive and bright color.
